# compose-minecraft-servers
A docker-compose running multiple Minecraft Servers loading a specific map each.

You only have to create a folder called '.map' or else in your version folder, where there'll be inside the Minecraft World's folders, respectivly : 

- 'world',
- 'world_nether'
- world_the_end'

If these folders aren't created the server'll create a new one for each missing world.
